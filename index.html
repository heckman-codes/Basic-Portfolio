        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>My name is Liam Heckman. I was born in Hawaii and moved to California at a young age. But I have lived by the coast almost my whole life. After I graduated high school, I moved to Sacramento to go to school at California State University Sacramento. Initially I enrolled as a physics major but changed to Graphic Design. In December of 2017, I graduated with my Bachelors and began to look for work. For the past three years, I have worked in design doing advertisements and animations for clients in the produce, deli, and real estate industries.</p>
        <p>I love rock climbing. In 2012 I was introduced to in when I first moved into the dorms and wanted to make friends. Since then, I climb in the gym three times a week and outside at least once a week. Sticking to mostly day trips I boulder, which is shorter, difficult climbs. But I have a few notable ascents of mountains like Half Dome in Yosemite, CA, and Tenaya Peak in Tuolumne, CA.</p>
